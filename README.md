# Fraud-Detection-using-Self-Organizing-Maps

Implement SOM model to solve fraud detection. The dataset contains information of customers from a bank applying for an advanced credit card.
So basically, these informations are the data that customer provide when filling the application form. And the end goal, is to detect potential fraud
within these applications. By the end, we have to give the explicit list, of the customers who potentially cheated.
So our goal is very explicit, we have to return something however, to return this something, that is the list of
potential fraudulent customers, its not a supervised deep learning model
that try to predict if each customer potentially cheated, yes or no, with a dependent variable
that has binary values. No, it is an unsupervised deep learning, which means that we identify some patterns
in a high dimensional datasets full of nonlinear relationships. And one of these patterns will be the potential fraud. That is the customers who potentially cheated.
